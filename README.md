# PROJECT : AUTHENTICATION BASICS and SECURITY CONFIGURATION using node.js(tutorial)

Creating users and allowing them to log in and out of a web apps is a crucial functionality that I am ready to learn!. In this lesson we‚Äôre going to be using passportJs an excellent middleware to handle the user's authentication and sessions.

I am going to be building a very minimal express app that will allow users to sign up, login and log out. For now I am just going to keep everything except the views in one file to make for easier demonstration, but in a real world project, it is best practice to split our concerns and functionality into separate modules.

> This project is part of a series of lessons to be completed by developers in [The_Odin_Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/authentication-basics).

## Built With
- Express.js.
- PassportJS
- Npm.
- ES6.
- bcrypt.js

## Learning Outcomes

### PassportJS
- Understand the use order for the required middleware.
- Describe what Strategies are.
- Use the LocalStrategy to authenticate users.
- Explain the purpose of cookies in authentication.
- Refreshed on prior learning material (routes, templates, middleware)
- Use PassportJS to setup user authentication with Express.

### Data Security/Safety
- Describe what bcrypt is and its use.
- Explain the importance of password hashing.
- Describe bcrypt‚Äôs compare function.

### Security Configuration.
- Access environment variables using the process object in node
- Use dotenv to store and make environment variables available to the application globally.
- Describe how environment variables are handled in version control.
- Work with nconf‚Äôs hierarchical configuration

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
